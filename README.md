# Blip App
### In development by Jude Southworth, Sean Hatch and Troy Priestley.
## What is Blip?
Blip is our first app project for android, using Python Kivy.

# TODO List
This is the TODO list. It lists, in priority, the tasks which need to be done.
When you complete a task, move it to the bottom of the list.
When you start to work on a task or wish to reserve a task for yourself, put your initial (J/S/T) in square brackets after it.

__DO NOT renumber the tasks, *unless you are changing a task's priority*. We can trace our progress by keeping the numbers as they get ticked off__

__Everyone should have at least one task at any given time. If you do not have a task, anyone is free to assign you a task__

* __10:Fix bugs__ [S/J/T]
* __16:Add more spike patterns__ [J/S/T]
* 23:Colourise Background [J][QUERY]
